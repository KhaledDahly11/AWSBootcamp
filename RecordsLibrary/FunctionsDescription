		*Note: the result of matches search is put in "Rows" variable.
		1.Incase of empty Rows (no match) and:
			1.1 the selected operation is add, we add the record to the libray
			1.2 the selected operation is update/delete, we return a failed message
		2.Incase of size of "Rows" is 1 (one exact match) and:
			2.1 add operation, we sum the exisiting copes and the added copies
			2.2 update operation, we substitue the existing copies with the copies

			a menu containing the only match to make sure this is the record name 
			we want.
